# 🏅 SAApp – Sports Association App

> **CMPS251 – Object-Oriented Programming | Qatar University**

**SAApp** is a console-based Java application built as part of the CMPS251 course at Qatar University. The project demonstrates the practical application of core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—tailored around a simulated sports association system.

---

## 📌 Overview

SAApp is designed to simulate real-world sports organization operations. The system allows users to manage and interact with:

- Player profiles and performance statistics
- Coaches and their assigned teams
- Sports clubs and supported disciplines
- Administrator-level tasks and reporting functions

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Architecture** with classes like `Player`, `Coach`, `Club`, `Sport`, and `Administrator`
- **Inheritance & Interfaces** with an abstract superclass `Person`, extended by specific roles
- **Encapsulation** through private fields and public accessors
- **Interactive Console UI** for adding, editing, and searching entities
- **Dynamic Reporting** for sorting, filtering, and classifying data by roles and attributes
